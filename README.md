# To-Do-Calendar
This was a project I completed with a couple of friends in my senior year of high school. With this program, users are able to add tasks to a list with a few different fields and actually see them in a formatted calendar. To add tasks, scroll down and fill in the required fields before clicking "submit task". When tasks are completed, they can be removed by simply clicking on them. Whenever you would like to see your completed tasks, you may click on the designated button and move them back to un-completed tasks if you would like.
